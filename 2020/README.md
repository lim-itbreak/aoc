# AoC 2020

My inelegant but simplistic solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

No external dependencies, but does require Python 3.10 - I really wanted to try out `match`, so sue me!

Scripts/tests can be run after changing the working directory to the containing `day_##` folder.

Code is `isort`ed, `black`end, and `pytest`ed.  I may be over-type-hinting, but it's mostly for practice/experimentation.
